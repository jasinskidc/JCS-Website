Just using this as a personal tracker for the work i put into the site.

jewelschristianschool.com

planned to finish landing page before 9/15.
I want 3 pages done by then.

This project will encompass:
-The Website, duh
-A student Database, not tracked through git, again duh
-A student/parent/admin dashboard on the site to track grades,
events, bills, etc.
-A test interface, not a full curriculum but a series of tests that a student could take like if they need a quick placement test to see where ,grade-wise, they place.
-Maybe a forum/messageboard for students to socialize and parents to talk directly with JCS
